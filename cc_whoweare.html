		<h2>Who We Are</h2>
		<p><strong>Welcome to Chandler Road Riders</strong>, a vibrant community of nearly 2,000 members spanning all ages and skill levels who share a passion for road biking and the outdoors. Our main rendezvous point is the Panera Bread parking lot at 2820 E. Germann Road in Chandler, where we gather every Sunday morning for the easiest ride of the week. The laid-back atmosphere makes it a perfect starting point for riders looking to enjoy a leisurely Sunday morning ride. But that's just the beginning!</p>
		
		<p>Throughout the week, our group organizes various rides tailored to different skill levels and preferences. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, we explore different routes around Chandler and neighboring areas, catering to intermediate and advanced riders. For those seeking a bit more thrill, our Saturday Sprint Series, happening on select Saturdays, is designed to push your limits and indulge in some friendly competition.</p>
		
		<p>We're not just about riding; <em>we're a community that values connections</em>. Join our Facebook group, Chandler Road Riders, for real-time updates, route details, and the opportunity to connect with fellow riders. Safety is our top priority, so helmets are a must on all rides. Whether you're a seasoned rider or new to group cycling, we welcome everyone to join us, enjoy the Arizona landscape, and make lasting memories on two wheels.</p>
		
		<p>For those with a passion for leading, we encourage members to become ride leaders and share their favorite routes. Additionally, we host social events and bike maintenance workshops beyond our regular rides. Chandler Road Riders isn't just a cycling group; it's a lifestyle. So, come pedal with us, make new friends, and embrace the joy of the ride in the heart of Arizona!</p>
		
		<p>See you on the roads, and happy cycling!</p>
